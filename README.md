* **Motivation of the project**  
  - The dilemma of negative pressure to work, which can cause burnout and lead to even less motivation to do work  
  - Instead of making schoolwork feel isolating or daunting, we aim to use positive social reinforcement to make getting work done easier  
  - Keeping track of the amount of work you've completed can be ambiguous, so an achievement system would provide a clear sign of progress  
  - Getting friends involved adds an element of competition to mundane tasks, encouraging productivity. A friendly leaderboard would gamify the experience and make it more engaging for users
