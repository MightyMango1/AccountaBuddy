* Motivation of the project 
  -  Dilemma of negative pressure to work, which can cause burnout and a bigger motivation not to do work
  -  Instead of making schoolwork feel isolating/daunting, we want to use positive social reinforcement to make getting work done easier
  -  Keeping track of the amount of work you have gotten done is sometimes ambiguous, so an achievement system would provide a sign of concrete progress
  -  By getting friends involved, an element of competition is added to possibly mundane tasks, making users more inclined to get their work done.  Using friendly competition through a leaderboard would gamify the product making it more interesting for the user
