* **Motivation of the project**
  - Dilemma of negative pressure to work, which can cause burnout and a bigger motivation not to do work  
  - Instead of making schoolwork feel isolating or daunting, we want to use positive social reinforcement to make getting work done easier  
  - Keeping track of the amount of work you have gotten done is sometimes ambiguous, so an achievement system would provide a sign of concrete progress  
  - By getting friends involved, an element of competition is added to possibly mundane tasks, making users more inclined to get their work done  
  - Using friendly competition through a leaderboard would gamify the product, making it more interesting for the user
